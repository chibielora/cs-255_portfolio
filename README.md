## Portfolio Submission for Module 8 of CS-255 System Analysis and Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well?**

The concept of DriverPass is very interesting, where the company would develop a web-application to provide instructional videos and support to schedule in-person driving lessons without leaving your home or having to call their office. The principle is to make it as easy as possible, so the student can focus on what is truly important. In this case, passing their driving test, so they can get their driving license. DriverPass requested from our fictional company at SNHU to develop an application for them that would align with modern design concepts, like ease of access, support, and improved user experience. One part of the project I was very proud of myself was the UML Class Diagram. I had to do extensive research to be able to get as close as possible of what a professional design should have looked like. Even if some minor errors are found, I think the effort I put in understanding the elements taught me a lot about this subject.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would improve my UML Use Case Diagram, to include instructors in the system. I thought about a minimalistic approach when I first developed this diagram, and wanted to make it as clear as possible, which is why I left out the extras that could have been included. The cart and the payment method were also left out of this diagram, because I included them as elements of the "Purchase Packages" object, and treated all of them as one entity.  

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

The first step I took was to read the client interview thoroughly and check their requirements. Then I wrote down the requests and organized them in order of importance through a user's perspective. Sometimes you can have a robust system that can do a lot of things, but can be obnoxious even to the own developers of the system. The best way to avoid having a product with a needlessly complex learning curve is to see yourself as a user of that system and question yourself about its functionality. For example: where would you go if you wanted to schedule a driving lesson? How is the checkout process on the website? Are the available payment methods sufficient and clear, or should we consider including more methods to improve it?
These and many more questions can be answered as you navigate the web-application and grade the functionalities by ease of usage and access.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I can be very methodical while creating a product, so I start with the client's requirements and build from there. Creating UML diagrams is a great way to list the goals you are trying to implement, when, and how. That is because the business perspective of the project and the developer perspective usually are approached distinctively. The business side must ensure that the project is presentable to stakeholders, clients, or even in-house managers. The developer side must ensure that the objects and methods are being understood by the other colleagues working together to build that application. The harder it is to understand each other, the longer the project takes and the easier it is to compromise budget and deadlines. Therefore, I would create different diagrams for each case and use a Gantt Chart to compare the overall progress of the project.
